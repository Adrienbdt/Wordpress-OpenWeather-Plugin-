### Date: 	        Submitted on 03-17-2021

### Location:	    Project is available on GITHUB at 
	
### Time Spent: 	Approximatively 30 hours

### Assumptions:	
*	Users will only want to access a minimum amount of details on their widget, to keep it as minimalist as possible
*	Users will only have access to the English version at the moment. 
*	A local installation of Wordpress will be required in order to use this plugin.
*	This is a work in progress, lots of features to be added.

### Shortcuts/Compromises made:
o	Design of the application could have benefited from some scripting (dynamic backgrounds for example).
o	Accessibility options and responsiveness could also be optimized depending on the position of other widgets.
o	Using AJAX calls could have allowed a real-time version.
o	Optimizing / re-factoring my code.
o	Administrator interactions, need to optimise the way I post my city array, it is working at the moment, but could be much better. 

### Stretch goals attempted 
•	Making successful API calls and displaying data successfully using PHP.
A lot of changes on my data structure throughout the development, trying to reduce the amounts of recursions.
•	Creating widgets for Wordpress:
It has been a while since I have “developed” for Wordpress, it was definitely a good challenge to get familiar with the environment once again.

### Instructions to run assignment locally 
1- Extract the zip file to your local wordpress – plugins folder:  \wordpress\wp-content\plugins
2- Access the Wordpress Admin Panel and access your plugin section
3- Select the open weather plugin and activate it
4- From your widget section, you can now drag and drop 

### What did you not include in your solution that you want us to know about? 
-	I could have handled all the calls using AJAX, but since we have a payload giving data every 3 hours, AJAX was not necessary.
-	Cities passed by the administrator can definitely be improved.
-	Adding some JS or a library could benefit the appearance of the plugin.

### Version 2”

Mandatory addons:
•	The user will be able to switch between the different units / metrics.
•	More information will be displayed / customised by the Administrator such as the humidity level, minimum  temperatures, max temperatures.
•	The responsiveness also gets improved, 3 to 4 formats available for wider and smaller viewports.
•	Multi languages added for a better accessibility.
•	Google Analytics integration in order to monitor and analyse KPIs (pay close attention to organic search, referrals)
•	Documenting the project as much as possible and keep track of the upcoming features / testing using Confluence - JIRA



Nice to have:
•	Background colors / images can also be customised , different layouts are available for the user.
•	Possible marketing campaign depending of our indicators and trackers
